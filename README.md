## There is a second package (flickr-react-app-theme) in the root of the project and it aim is to extract the codes for icons that are in an .svg file to subsequently used in the `client` app.

We want to be able to produce a list of `scss variables` and `mixins` that could then together with some other files form the theme in our react application.

## Start

run `npm i` to install the packages


## Steps

Open the project with VSCode and make sure that you replace the font files under `theme\fonts` with your files.

Then from the command line type the following:

`npm start`

Once run the output in the console will conain the necessary files that have been saved locally as well.

## Usage 

Now copy the `theme` folder in your solution and start using the theme.
